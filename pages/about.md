## About the Collection

David and Carol Butler were American United Methodist missionaries living and working and raising their four sons in north Africa until they retired in 1995, and moved back to United States where they settled down in Tennessee. While in the first 15 years of their careers, from 1961 to 1975, they moved around between Constantine, Algiers, and Tunis, with one year in Hartford, Conneticuit and four of them spent in Montreal, Canada, they spent the last 20 years, from 1975 to 1995, in Oran, Algeria. 

As a part of their work, they sent letters back to the States with updates on their work and family life, and other thoughts and experiences. This collection contains many of these letters from their time in Oran, along with some photographs.
