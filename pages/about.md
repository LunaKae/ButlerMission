## About the Collection

David and Carol Butler were American United Methodist missionaries living and working and raising their four sons in north Africa until they retired in 1995, and moved back to United States where they settled down in Tennessee. While in the beginning of their careers they moved around between Constantine, Algiers, and Tunis, with one year in Hartford, Conneticuit and four years spent in Montreal, Canada, they spent the last 20 years, from 1975 to 1995, in Oran, Algeria.
